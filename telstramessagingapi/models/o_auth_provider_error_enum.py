    Attributes:
        INVALID_REQUEST: The request is missing a required parameter, includes
            an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a
            parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one
            mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise
            malformed.
        INVALID_CLIENT: Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no
            client authentication included, or unsupported authentication
            method).
        INVALID_GRANT: The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization
            code, resource owner credentials) or refresh token is invalid,
            expired, revoked, does not match the redirection URI used in the
            authorization request, or was issued to another client.
        UNAUTHORIZED_CLIENT: The authenticated client is not authorized to use
            this authorization grant type.
        UNSUPPORTED_GRANT_TYPE: The authorization grant type is not supported
            by the authorization server.
        INVALID_SCOPE: The requested scope is invalid, unknown, malformed, or
            exceeds the scope granted by the resource owner.
