        mfrom (string): This will be the source address that will be displayed
            on the receiving device. If it is not present then it will default
            to the MSISDN assigned to the app. If replyRequest is set to true,
            then this field will be ignored.
        to (string): This is the destination address.
        subject (string): The subject that will be used in an MMS message.
        reply_request (bool): If set to true, the reply message functionality
            will be implemented and the to address will be ignored if
            present.
        mms_content (list of MMSContent): An Array of content that will be
            sent in an MMS message. If this array is present it will cause the
            “body” element to be ignored, and the message will be sent as an
            MMS.
