# Telstra Developer Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of Telstraâ€™s developer ecosystem pledge to make participation in our community a safe, inclusive and enjoyable experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation or any other identity characteristic.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that foster and support an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what's best &ndash;not just for us as individuals&ndash; but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Telstra community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Telstra community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove or, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki (Confluence) edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all Telstra community spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the community. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassment, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the Telstra community leaders responsible for enforcement at `telstradev@team.telstra.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and the privacy and security of the reporter will be respected.
