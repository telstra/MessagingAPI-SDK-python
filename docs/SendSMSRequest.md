## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**to** | **str** | Phone number (in E.164 format) to send the SMS to.  This number can be in international format &#x60;\&quot;to\&quot;: \&quot;+61412345678\&quot;&#x60; or in national format. Can be an array of strings if sending to multiple numbers: &#x60;\&quot;to\&quot;: \&quot;+61412345678, +61418765432\&quot;&#x60; | 
**body** | **str** | The text body of the message. Messages longer than 160 characters will be counted as multiple messages. This field contains the message text, this can be up to 1900 (for a single recipient) or 500 (for multiple recipients) UTF-8 characters. As mobile devices rarely support the full range of UTF-8 characters, it is possible that some characters may not be translated correctly by the mobile device | 
**_from** | **str** | The Alphanumeric sender ID of up to 11 characters or phone number the SMS was sent from. If not present, the service will use the mobile number associated with the application (in E.164 format). This feature is only available on paid plans. | [optional] 
**validity** | **int** | How long the platform should attempt to deliver the message for. This period is specified in minutes from the message. Normally if the message cannot be delivered immediately, it will be stored and delivery will be periodically reattempted. The network will attempt to send the message for up to seven days. It is possible to define a period smaller than 7 days by including this parameter and specifying the number of minutes that delivery should be attempted. eg: including &#x60;\&quot;validity\&quot;: 60&#x60; will specify that if a message can&#39;t be delivered within the first 60 minutes them the network should stop. | [optional] 
**scheduled_delivery** | **int** | How long the platform should wait before attempting to send the message - specified in minutes. e.g.: If &#x60;\&quot;scheduledDelivery\&quot;: 120&#x60; is included, then the network will not attempt to start message delivery for two hours after the message has been submitted | [optional] 
**notify_url** | **str** | Contains a URL that will be called once your message has been processed. The status may be delivered, expired, deleted, etc. It is possible for the network to make a call to a URL when the message has been delivered (or has expired), different URLs can be set per message. Please refer to the Delivery Notification section. | [optional] 
**reply_request** | **bool** | If set to true, the reply message functionality will be implemented and the to address will be ignored if present. If false or not present, then normal message handling is implemented. When set to true, network will use a temporary number to deliver this message. All messages sent by mobile to this temporary number will be stored against the same &#x60;messageId&#x60;. If a &#x60;notifyURL&#x60; is provided then user response will be delivered to the URL where &#x60;messageId&#x60; will be same as &#x60;messageId&#x60; in reponse to original API request. This field contains the message text, this can be up to 500 UTF-8 characters. As mobile devices rarely support the full range of UTF-8 characters, it is possible that some characters may not be translated correctly by the mobile device. | [optional] 
**priority** | **bool** | When messages are queued up for a number, then it is possible to set where a new message will be placed in the queue. If the priority is set to true then the new message will be placed ahead of all messages with a normal priority. If there are no messages queued for the number, then this parameter has no effect. | [optional]
